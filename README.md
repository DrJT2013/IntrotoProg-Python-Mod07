# IntrotoProg-Python-Mod07

In Module 07, we explored how to use classes and objects to create and manage structured data effectively in Python. The assignment focuses on extending a previous course registration program by incorporating data classes, class inheritance, and properties. Additionally, the program emphasizes structured error handling to ensure robust functionality and user-friendly interactions.
This assignment required creating a Python program that registers students for courses, displays current enrollments, and saves data to a file using JSON format.
